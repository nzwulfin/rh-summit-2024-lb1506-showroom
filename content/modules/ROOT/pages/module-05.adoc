= Deploying a bootc virtual machine with Anaconda

In this lab you will learn the basics of deploying a bootc image using Anaconda and an
all in one `iso` image.

Anaconda is the official Red Hat Enterprise Linux installer and it uses Kickstart as it's scripting language.
Recently, Kickstart received a new command called `ostreecontainer`.

[#build]
== Building an installation iso with the bootc container

In this lab, you will be using the CentOS Stream 9 minimal installation iso image
as it is publicly available, but rest assured that the steps are identical for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4 `iso` image
and even for Fedora 40 or newer.

The image should have been already downloaded at the setup phase at the beginning of this workshop. You can check it exists
by listing the file `/var/lib/libvirt/images/summit/rhel-boot.iso` as root:

[source,bash]
----
sudo ls -lah /var/lib/libvirt/images/summit/rhel-boot.iso
----

If it is missing, you can redownload it by calling `make iso-download`.

Next, make sure you have pushed the bootc container image to the local registry:

----
podman push summit.registry/lb1506:bootc
----

The actual generation of the custom `iso` image is out of scope for this workshop, so we are providing a convenient script to do so:

[source,bash]
----
make iso CONTAINER=summit.registry/lb1506:bootc
----

At the end of the run, you should be able to list the file `/var/lib/libvirt/images/summit/rhel-boot-custom.iso` as root:

----
sudo ls -lah /var/lib/libvirt/images/summit/rhel-boot-custom.iso
----

For reference, the script used to embed and build the custom iso can be found in `bin/embed-container` and it can
be resumed with the following steps (*no need to run these commands*):

  1. use `skopeo` to copy the container image to a temporary directoy on disk:

+
----
skopeo copy "docker://summit.registry/lb1506:bootc" "oci:${TEMPDIR}/container/"
----

  2. generate a Kickstart file (more details below)
  3. create the new iso using `mkksiso`

+
----
mkksiso --ks local.kickstart --add ${TEMPDIR}/container/ original.iso custom.iso
----

The Kickstart added to the iso is in `config/local.ks` and looks like this:

----
text
network --bootproto=dhcp --device=link --activate
clearpart --all --initlabel --disklabel=gpt
reqpart --add-boot
part / --grow --fstype xfs

ostreecontainer --url=/run/install/repo/container --transport=oci

firewall --disabled
services --enabled=sshd
sshkey --username lab-user "SSHKEY"
user --name="lab-user" --groups=wheel --plaintext --password=lb1506
rootpw lb1506
poweroff
----

Please note there are no rpm packages mentioned anywhere, just a `ostreecontainer` command:

  * `--url=/run/install/repo/container` -> path to the local container in the iso but it can also directly take a publicly available registry
  * `--transport=oci` -> the format in which the container is available, in this case `oci`

If you wanted to deploy directly from a container registry, the `ostreecontainer` command would look like this (*no need to run this command*):

----
ostreecontainer --url=quay.io/myorg/myimage:mytag
----

[#run]
== Starting the installation with Anaconda in a virtual machine

In the previous section, you have created a custom installation iso. Let's see how a virtual machine booting off that image looks like. Creating
a virtual machine from scratch is out of scope for this workshop, so we have provided a script to create the virtual machine:

----
make vm-iso
----

The command above will start the installation process and you should be able to see the console of a newly created virtual machine
booting from the custom iso and automatically starting the installation process. This process is cumbersome for virtual machines, 
but it is the process most generally used for bare metal hosts. It shows how a container image can make it's way anywhere with a 
couple of simple commands and scripts. It's also important to note, everything needed is inside the custom iso created and at no
point is network access required.

You can now see if the virtual machine is running:

[source,bash]
----
virsh --connect qemu:///system list

 Id   Name   State
----------------------
 1    qcow   running
 4    iso    running
----

[#test]
== Test and login to the virtual machine

Like with the previous virtual machine created, you can directly see if the http application is already running on the host:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://iso-vm
----

The output should be the already known "Hello Red Hat"

You should also be able to login to the virtual machine:

----
ssh lab-user@iso-vm
----

If the ssh key is not automatically picked up, use the password `lb1506`.

You can now check the status of `bootc`:

----
bootc status
----

The output should be similar to this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: org.containers.bootc/v1alpha1
kind: BootcHost
metadata:
  name: host
spec:
  image:
    image: /run/install/repo/container
    transport: oci
  bootOrder: default
status:
  staged: null
  booted:
    image:
      image:
        image: /run/install/repo/container

      timestamp: null
      imageDigest: sha256:0a3daed6e31c2f2917e17ea994059e1aaee0481fe16836c118c5e1d10a87365c

      deploySerial: 0
  rollback: null
  rollbackQueued: false
  type: bootcHost
----

[#switch]
== Switching to the actual container image

One thing that immediately is obvious in the `bootc status` output is that the deployed image image is a local path:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  image:
    image: /run/install/repo/container
    transport: oci
  bootOrder: default
----

Because in the deployment step the container image was included in the installation iso, the reference to the registry container image
is lost. This can be easily fixed by first pulling the image:

[source,bash]
----
sudo podman pull --tls-verify=false summit.registry/lb1506:bootc
----

And then switching our installation to use the new container image:

[source,bash]
----
sudo bootc switch --transport containers-storage summit.registry/lb1506:bootc
----

The output should look like this:

----
Loading usr/lib/ostree/prepare-root.conf
Queued for next boot: ostree-unverified-image:containers-storage:summit.registry/lb1506:bootc
  Version: 9.20240501.0
  Digest: sha256:0a3daed6e31c2f2917e17ea994059e1aaee0481fe16836c118c5e1d10a87365c
----

At this point, the "new" installation has been prepared and will be started at next boot of the virtual machine.
One last look at the status:

[source,bash]
----
sudo bootc status
----

Should give the following output:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: org.containers.bootc/v1alpha1
kind: BootcHost
metadata:
  name: host
spec:
  image:
    image: summit.registry/lb1506:bootc

      deploySerial: 0
  rollback: null
  rollbackQueued: false
  type: bootcHost
----

Please take note of the `staged` section, which shows what is prepared for the next boot and the `booted` section which shows the currently
booted status. For this exercise, these two differ only in name and source but it does show a regular workflow in using os containers.

The last step for the change to take is to reboot the virtual machine. Before doing it, please make sure you are logged in to the
virtual machine and not the hypervisor (the prompt should look like `[lab-user@lb1506-vm ~]$`):

[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl reboot
----

In a short time after that command, you should be able to ssh back to the virtual machine:

[source,bash]
----
ssh lab-user@iso-vm
----

And check the bootc status:

[source,bash]
----
sudo bootc status
----

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: org.containers.bootc/v1alpha1
kind: BootcHost
metadata:
  name: host
spec:
  image:
    image: summit.registry/lb1506:bootc
    transport: containers-storage
  bootOrder: default
status:
  staged: null
  booted:
    image:
      image:
        image: summit.registry/lb1506:bootc

    cachedUpdate: null
    incompatible: false
    pinned: false
    ostree:

      deploySerial: 0
  rollback:
    image:
      image:
        image: /run/install/repo/container
        transport: oci
      version: 9.20240501.0
      timestamp: null
      imageDigest: sha256:0a3daed6e31c2f2917e17ea994059e1aaee0481fe16836c118c5e1d10a87365c
    cachedUpdate: null
    incompatible: false
    pinned: false
    ostree:
      checksum: 42f36e87a9436d505b3993822b92dbf7961ad3f1a8fddf67b91746df365784f0
      deploySerial: 0
  rollbackQueued: false
  type: bootcHost
----

You can now see the `booted` section mentiones out container image and there is a new `rollback` section. We will address this section in a future lab.

You can explore the virtual machine before moving on to the next section:

  * `systemctl status httpd` -> see the `httpd` service we have enabled in the Containerfile
  * `cat /var/www/html/index.html` -> see the index.html file we have created in the Containerfile

Before proceeding, make sure you have logged out of the virtual machine:

[source,bash]
----
logout
----

The prompt should read `[lab-user@hypervisor rh-summit-2024-lb1506]$` before continuing.
