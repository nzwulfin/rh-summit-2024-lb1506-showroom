= Deploying a bootc container from inside a running system

Bootc containers are self deploying and a novel method of installation involves transforming a regular
Linux host into a bootc backed host.


[#create-bootc]
== Add authentication method to Containerfile

When using this method of deployment, passwords and/or ssh keys need to be added directly to the container image. You
need to edit the `Containerfile` to the following:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/rhel9/rhel-bootc:9.4

RUN dnf install -y httpd
RUN echo "Hello Red Hat" > /var/www/html/index.html
RUN systemctl enable httpd

ADD certs/004-summit.conf /etc/containers/registries.conf.d/004-summit.conf

ARG SSHPUBKEY
ADD templates/30-auth-system.conf /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/30-auth-system.conf
RUN mkdir -p /usr/ssh
RUN echo ${SSHPUBKEY} > /usr/ssh/root.keys && chmod 0600 /usr/ssh/root.keys

ENTRYPOINT /usr/sbin/httpd -DFOREGROUND
----

Please notice the top part is still the httpd server we started this workshop with, but there are now 
a couple of new lines:

  * `ADD certs/004-summit.conf /etc/containers/registries.conf.d/004-summit.conf` -> will allow us to pull container images without TLS verification and is only necessary in this dev environment with self signed certificates for the registry.
  * `ARG SSHPUBKEY` -> adds a new build-time argument for `podman` to be used as the public ssh key
  * `ADD templates/30-auth-system.conf /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/30-auth-system.conf` -> add configuration for ssh to take authorization keys from the usual HOMEDIR path *and* from `/usr/ssh/root.keys`

+
The contents of this file is

+
----
AuthorizedKeysFile /usr/ssh/%u.keys .ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys2
----

  * `RUN mkdir -p /usr/ssh` -> create the new keys directory
  * `RUN echo ${SSHPUBKEY} > /usr/ssh/root.keys && chmod 0600 /usr/ssh/root.keys` -> write the build time argument as the ssh key for the `root` user

You can now build the new container image with with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
podman build --build-arg SSHPUBKEY="$(cat  ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)" --file Containerfile --tag summit.registry/lb1506:bootc-auth
----

Please take note of the `--build-arg SSHPUBKEY="$(cat  ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)"` argument, which replaces `${SSHPUBKEY}` in the Containerfile with 
the pregenerated ssh key stored in the file `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.

If the build command was successful, make sure to push the new container image to our local registry:

[source,bash]
----
podman push summit.registry/lb1506:bootc-auth
----

[#create-vm]
== Creating the classic Linux host

In this part you need to create a "regular" Linux virtual machine. The exact steps for creating a
virtual machine are out of scope for this workshop, but you have a ready made script to do just that:

[source,bash]
----
make vm-regular
----

The command above will download and start a CentOS Stream 9 virtual machine and inject it with the already generated
ssh key.

You can now check the virtual machine has been created:

[source,bash]
----
virsh --connect qemu:///system list
----

The output should contain a virtual machine called `regular`.

Before moving forward, you can quickly check that the new virtual machine is *not* running the http application:

----
curl http://regular-vm
----

The above command should fail.

[#bootc-deploy]
== Selfdeploying the bootc container

Having created the `regular` virtual machine, you can now ssh into it:

[source,bash]
----
ssh root@regular-vm
----

Before moving forward, you can explore this regular virtual machine:

  * `bootc status` -> should fail as there is no `bootc` commmand
  * `cat /etc/os-release` -> should show you a standard CentOS Stream 9 host

Now, inside the virtual machine, you can use `podman` to pull the bootc container:

[source,bash]
----
podman pull summit.registry/lb1506:bootc-auth
----

And you can now use the container image to self deploy!

[source,bash]
----
podman run --rm --privileged \
        --pid=host --security-opt label=type:unconfined_t \
        --volume /dev:/dev \
        --volume /var/lib/containers:/var/lib/containers \
        --volume /:/target \
        --entrypoint bootc \
        summit.registry/lb1506:bootc-auth \
        install to-filesystem --skip-fetch-check --replace=alongside /target
----

The output of the previous command should like like this:

----
Installing image: docker://summit.registry/lb1506:bootc-auth
Digest: sha256:783522458bb01c7c9870f03b21cbad7497edbb5e95fc59d7a2c3ada7141929fa
Initializing ostree layout
Initializing sysroot
ostree/deploy/default initialized as OSTree stateroot
Deploying container image
Deployment complete
Running bootupctl to install bootloader
Installed: grub.cfg
Installation complete!
----

If the deployment was successful, you can now reboot the virtual machine and login to the new system! Before doing so,
please make sure you are logged in to the virtual machine and not the hypervisor (the prompt should look like `[root@regular-vm ~]#`):


[source,bash]
----
systemctl reboot
----

Before logging in to the new virtual machine, you can check if the http application is already working:

----
curl http://regular-vm
----

After a brief moment, you should be able to log back into the (now) bootc system:

[source,bash]
----
ssh-keygen -R regular-vm
ssh root@regular-vm
----

Like for the first virtual machine, you can now check the bootc status:

[source,bash]
----
bootc status
----

The output should look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: org.containers.bootc/v1alpha1
kind: BootcHost
metadata:
  name: host
spec:
  image:
    image: summit.registry/lb1506:bootc-auth

      deploySerial: 0
  rollback: null
  rollbackQueued: false
  type: bootcHost
----

Congratulations, you have successfully deployed and booted a bootc container on a running host!

And the `httpd` service is running. We can verify that we get "Hello Red Hat" when curling the VM:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://regular-vm
----

Before proceeding, make sure you have logged out of the virtual machine:

[source,bash]
----
logout
----

The prompt should read `[lab-user@hypervisor rh-summit-2024-lb1506]$` before continuing.
